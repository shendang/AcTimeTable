# ACTimeTable

This WeChat miniprogram called "AcTimeTable"

With this app, you can quickly view your time table on your WeChat as well as your friends's.

The most important function of this app is Share and Follow, which is why I want to build it.

Considering this situation: Plan to go shopping with friends who are also your classmnates, but you dont know when he/she is free, then you want to view his/her timeTable to make the schedule. It's so troubled to ask your friends to sent the time table to you ! With AcTimeTable, it's easily to view your others' time table !
